Mountain-Atmosphere Radiative Transfer (MART) in Snow Environment, MARTiSE.
MARTiSE is a model framework for apparent spectral quantities (radiance, bidirectional reflectance) of snow cover, with advanced considerations of coupled atmospheric and topographic effects.
Driven by several modules including satellite image module (Landsat-8/9, Sentinel-2 and so on), atmosphere module (6S), surface BRDF module (ART for snow cover), topography module and radiation module, it generates satellite TOA radiance/reflectance images of snow-covered mountains.
